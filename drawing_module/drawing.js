The app captures touch or stylus input and tracks the movement across the screen.

Each movement is converted into a series of points or paths in real time.

These points are rendered as lines using the selected color, thickness, and style.

The drawing updates continuously to give smooth, natural feedback to the user.

All strokes are saved so the drawing can be edited, cleared, or restored later.
