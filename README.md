The Notes App has been enhanced with a dedicated drawing feature that enables users to create freehand sketches and handwritten notes directly within the app. A new drawing folder has been introduced to structure and isolate all drawing-related logic in a clean, modular, and maintainable manner. The drawing system captures touch or stylus input, processes movement as continuous strokes, and renders them in real time. Users can customize stroke properties such as color and thickness to improve the drawing experience. Drawing data is stored efficiently to support redrawing, editing, and clearing actions. This update improves overall usability while maintaining a professional and scalable codebase.
