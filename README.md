This Notes App includes a drawing feature that allows users to freely sketch or write on the screen using touch input or a stylus. The app continuously tracks touch movements and records them as a series of points. These points are connected to form smooth strokes in real time. Each stroke is rendered instantly with the selected color and thickness to provide natural feedback. The drawing updates dynamically as the user moves their finger or stylus. All strokes are stored so the drawing can be redrawn, edited, or cleared later. This logic enables intuitive and responsive drawing directly within the notes.
